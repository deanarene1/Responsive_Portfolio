        <p class="textcolor"> My name is Deana Baker and I am a single mother to the sassiest three year old on the planet. I have spent the last
            few years of my life working as an independent contractor/brand ambassador for a ton of companies and also have
            bartended on the side.
            <br>
            <br>Originally, I wanted to be a nurse and took up two years of community college doing general coursework before
            I realized it wasnt what I wanted to do. I am now ready to embark on my career as a software engineer, as I have
            finally found something that I love. I am currently a student through the University of Arizona at the coding
            bootcamp. Upon graduation in October of 2018, I plan to finish my associates degree in computer science since
            my general college coursework is already completed.
            <br>
            <p class="tab textcolor"> My hobbies include hiking, reading, writing, Grey's Anatomy or Harry Potter marathons, 
            yoga, cross-training at the gym and now more recently, coding and thinking of new ideas for future apps I can 
            build to help people or solve a problem.
